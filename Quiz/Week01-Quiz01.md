# I. Introduction 

## Question 1

A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. Suppose we feed a learning algorithm a lot of historical weather data, and have it learn to predict weather. In this setting, what is T?

### Answer

* **The probability of it correctly predicting a future date's weather.**
* The process of the algorithm examining a large amount of historical weather data.
* The weather prediction task.
* None of these.

## Question 2

Suppose you are working on weather prediction, and you would like to predict weather or not it will be raining at 5pm tomorrow. You want to use a learning algorithm for this. Would you treat this as a classification or a regression problem?

### Answer

* **Classification**
* Regression
