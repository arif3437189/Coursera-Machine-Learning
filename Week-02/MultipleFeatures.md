# Multiple Features

**Note:** [7:25 - ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Ctheta%20%5E%7BT%7D) is a 1 by (n+1) matrix and not an (n+1) by 1 matrix]

Linear regression with multiple variables is also known as "multivariate linear regression".

We now introduce notation for equations where we can have any number of input variables.

x(i)j
x(i)
m
n
![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x_%7Bj%7D%5E%7Bi%7D) = value of feature j in the ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?i%5E%7Bth%7D) training example
![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x%5E%7Bi%7D) = the column vector of all the feature inputs of the ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?i%5E%7Bth%7D) training example
m = the number of training examples
n = ||![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x%5E%7Bi%7D)||;(the number of features)
